# Compiler C

This repository is a C compiler for x86 implemented at INSA Lyon.

## Authors and major contributors

* Rivaldo De Souza
* Emmanuel Garreau
* Mathis Goichon
* BÃ©renger Mayoud--Dupin
* Paul Souteyrat

## Build project

### Ubuntu

To build the project, go to **CompilerC** directory and use:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --target compiler
```

### Windows

Prefer use WSL Ubuntu and run the two commands given above.

## Test framework

To run the test framework, you have to:

```bash
cd tests
python3 ifcc-test.py .
```

## About grammar generation

If you make any change in the grammar, you can generate Cpp code with the following commands:

```bash
cd compiler
java -cp ../antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar org.antlr.v4.Tool -lib ./ -visitor -listener -Dlanguage=Cpp -o ./generated ./ifcc.g4
```

## About CI/CD

We have implemented a CI/CD which build and execute the tests.

You can access our workflows through the Actions tab and then by selecting one of the jobs.

You will find a full report in the unit test result : https://github.com/PeredurOmega/CompilerC/actions/runs/2503655455

You can also download the artifact of the test output.

## Roadmap
